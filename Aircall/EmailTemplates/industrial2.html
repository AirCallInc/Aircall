            <p>
                While we would like to respond and provide coverage for all potential problems with your unit (and we do try to cover almost every possible type
                of repair) there are certain events and services <strong><u>are not </u></strong>included with your package<strong>:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                (a) We <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do not</strong></span> provide painting and/or surface preparation of your Unit. For an additional charge, as required, to help prevent corrosion and deterioration of exterior equipment surfaces we will perform this service.

                (b) We <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do not</strong></span> repair existing HVAC system design issues. For example, poor air flow design, undersized refrigerant lines, code violations and safety issues are not covered repairs. We will, free of additional charge, identify for you existing system design issues and propose corrective actions for the proper operation of your system. We can perform these repairs for you at your request as part of a separate agreement, in writing, between us.
